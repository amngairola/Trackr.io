# 🚀 DailyDSA - The Consistency Tracker

**DailyDSA** is a centralized platform for developers to track their progress across different coding platforms (LeetCode, GFG, CodingNinjas). 

### 💡 The Problem
Most students fail at DSA not because they lack skill, but because they lack **consistency**. They waste time deciding "what to solve next" or lose motivation after a few days.

### 🛠 The Solution
DailyDSA forces a habit loop by providing:
1.  **Curated Sheets:** Access industry-standard sheets (Striver’s, Love Babbar’s) or upload your own via Markdown.
2.  **The "Daily 2":** A smart algorithm that serves 2 random, unsolved problems every day.
3.  **Visual Analytics:** Heatmaps and progress bars to visualize your momentum.
4.  **Role-Based Security:** Admins manage the ecosystem; Students manage their growth.

### ⚡ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** MongoDB (Aggregations & Indexing)
* **Auth:** JWT with HTTP-Only Cookies
