/*
Explore Page (/explore)
Backend Data: /get-public-sheet

Layout: A clean Grid of Cards.

Design:

Header: "Explore System Sheets" (Title).

Grid: A 3x3 grid of SheetCard components.

Card Look: Since these are "System" sheets (like Blind 75), give them a special gold border or badge to show they are "Official".
